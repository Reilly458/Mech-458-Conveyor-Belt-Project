# Conveyor Belt Project

## Goal:
Design and implement a sorting system to sort an unknown quantity of items of different material types and/or colours using the provided DC motor conveyor belt, stepper motor controlled sorting bin, ferromagetic, optical and reflective sensors. The sensors combined with an ADC determine the material type (aluminum, steel or plastic) and color (black or white for plastic). Speed of the conveyor belt and sorting bin must be determined and optimized to provide the fastest sorting time with the highest accuracy; no more than 2 errors before points were deducted.  

## Result:
Our fasted time was 45 seconds with 1 error. The link for a video of this can be found in the repo file named "Final Testing Video".
